# Site Admin Dashboard Redesign

## Overview

The site admin dashboard has been redesigned with a modern card-based layout. Each app now has its own dedicated card with an appropriate icon, and the Recent Actions section has been narrowed for better focus. The dark mode functionality has been extended to work on the sidebar and top navigation bar as well.

## Key Changes

- Cards feature distinctive icons relevant to the app's function

- Hover effects provide visual feedback and improved user experience

### 2. Reduced Recent Actions Width
- Recent Actions section has been restyled to a maximum width of 300px
- Action items have been enhanced with colorful badges
- Each action type (Add, Edit, Delete) has its own color

### 3. Dark Mode Integration
- Dark mode toggle now affects sidebar and top navigation
- Color scheme is consistent across the entire interface
- Theme preference is saved in localStorage for persistence
- Smooth transitions between light and dark modes

### 4. Improved Visual Design
- Icons added throughout the interface for better visual cues
- Consistent color palette using CSS variables

- Subtle animations and transitions for a modern feel

### 5. Testing and Verification
- All admin URLs have been tested for functionality
