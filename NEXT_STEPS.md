# Next Steps for CRM-Leads Project

## What We've Accomplished

1. Confirmed that `django-tenants` is properly installed in your environment
2. Created scripts for setting up and configuring the project:
   - `check_postgres.py`: Verifies PostgreSQL installation and connection
   - `setup_postgres.py`: Configures PostgreSQL for django-tenants
   - `create_tenants_app.py`: Sets up the tenants app
   - `create_leads_app.py`: Sets up the leads app
   - `setup.py`: Master script to guide through the entire setup process
3. Created comprehensive templates and models for a leads management system
4. Added detailed documentation in README.md

## Current Issue

We've identified an issue with the psycopg2 installation:

- The module is installed but there are DLL load issues
- This is a common problem on Windows systems with psycopg2
- We've added troubleshooting information to the README.md

## What You Need to Do Next

1. **Fix psycopg2 Installation**
   - Follow the troubleshooting steps in README.md
   - Option 1: Add PostgreSQL bin directory to your PATH
   - Option 2: Copy required DLLs from PostgreSQL to Python
   - Option 3: Install a pre-compiled wheel from Christoph Gohlke's website

2. **Complete PostgreSQL Setup**
   - Once psycopg2 is working, run `python setup_postgres.py`
   - This will create the database and configure it for django-tenants

3. **Run Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations tenants
   python manage.py makemigrations leads
   python manage.py migrate_schemas --shared
   python manage.py migrate_schemas
   ```

4. **Create a Superuser**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Create Your First Tenant**
   - Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/
   - Log in with your superuser credentials
   - Create a client in the Clients section
   - Add a domain for the client (e.g., `client1.localhost`)
   - Add entries to your hosts file to map the domain to 127.0.0.1
   - Access the tenant site at `http://client1.localhost:8000/`

## Summary

You now have all the components needed for a multi-tenant CRM system. The main blocker is resolving the psycopg2 installation issue, which is common on Windows systems. Once that's resolved, you can follow the remaining setup steps to get your system up and running.

The multi-tenant architecture will allow you to serve multiple clients from a single Django installation, with each client's data isolated in its own PostgreSQL schema.
